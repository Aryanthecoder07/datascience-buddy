            <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
            <p>Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that leverages various scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data. Key components of data science include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering data from various sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Preprocessing data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Applying statistical and computational techniques to explore and summarize data characteristics.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Developing predictive models and algorithms to make data-driven decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate insights effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data scientists work across various industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and technology, to uncover patterns, predict trends, and inform strategic decisions. The ultimate goal is to transform data into actionable insights that drive business value and innovation.</p>
